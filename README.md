Just walked out. Still feels like the walls are moving or it's my brain. Picture This. wild ride, man. Like a dream but maybe one of those dreams when you eat too much cheese before bed, you know? The theater was loud! Like people were more popcorn than human at this point. My back's protesting the chairs. No one told me it'd be an endurance test.

The  , ha, it's starting to fade already, but the colors! Like someone spilled a paint set all over the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 reel. There was this one scene where the sky flipped itself over like a pancake. Or was that a metaphor for their relationship? Who knows. But the music, like being wrapped in a symphony of yawns and cries, if that makes sense. It doesn't. But it does.

> Weird bit with the dog, was it even real or some kind of metaphor monster? I should be able to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later, bet it'll make even less sense at home. Or maybe more, once the dizziness wears off. Did you say you wanted to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   too? 

Doesn't help with the sticky floor sensation. Popcorn crumbs are colonizing my jeans as we speak. The theater itself is like sitting inside a buzzing bee. I swear I thought I heard whispers, but that might have just been the speakers hissing. Those characters. So bloody relatable. One minute lost in pixels, the next, they're like your uncle at a barbecue who tells awful jokes but you laugh anyway because hey, barbecue.

> Remember the ending? What the hell was that? Did they just decide halfway to throw a plot-twist javelin just for laughs? Kinda loved that though, like life throwing curveballs when you least expect.

Lost touch with the plot in the middle there, kinda like when your GPS tells you to turn left right off a bridge. But, would 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 again, especially the part where they chase dreams like cats with laser pointers. Hilarious. Yet something about the shadows, they moved like they had secrets of their own.

Oh, I was supposed to meet someone after... ?? Was it today or tomorrow? Or never. Bing bong. When.. was...
